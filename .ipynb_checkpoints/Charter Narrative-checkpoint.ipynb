    "   EPR and ODNP operations have been significantly impacted by lapses in instrumentation and software maintenance. In addition, the loss of key personnel has left researchers with partial or inaccurate information about how to operate the instruments and software; which is leading to further maintenance issues. Data quality is suffering, instruments are being damaged, maintenance is becoming more difficult to perform, analysis software is failing without explanation, money is being wasted dealing with avoidable issues, and researchers are losing time and collecting poor quality data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This project will include five components: 1) instruments that have been neglected will be repaired or restored, 2) for equipment that needs professionbal repair and are outside of warranty, proposals will be written to gain funds and send the equipment for repair, 3) facilities and infrastructure will be optimized or upgraded as necessary, 4) new software and applications will be developed to more accurately and reliably process data with transparency in the calculation procedures, and 5) documentation will be generated to ensure continued maintenance, correct operation, and easy adoptability of procedures by future researchers."
